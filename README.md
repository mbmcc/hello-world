# hello-world
My basic repository where I store snippest to use elsewhere and learn about git.

I am a curious fellow, and my inquiries can lead me far afield. Computers seem to be a good fit for my kind of curiosity. I was the only student in my school (I was in first grade) allowed to operate the schools brand new Apple IIe, and I liked playing Oregon Trail. My ability to access a computer was very limited though, and so I spend a lot of time drawing and wandering around outside. Fastforward many years, and I am just leaving Highschool to go into the navy and really learn about computers. I spend a lot of time learning about boolean math, binary, octal and hexidecimal numbering systems and other foundational computing stuff. Eventually I started learning usefull SysAdmin stuff. I've been doing mainly SysAdmin stuff in one form or another since. It's not as engaging as it used to be, and my mostly military based knowlege is not as marketable as I would like. 
I've liked coding when given the chance, so now I'm going to invest in coding as a skill set and see where this takes me. I hear about a lot of satisfied folks in Software Engineering / Software Development and it seems to have the flexibility that I'm looking for.
